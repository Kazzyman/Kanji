				1. The universe is quantum fields -- and it is nothing else.
				2. Quantum Field Theory is deterministic; ergo, the universe is deterministic.
				3. Even in principle, quantum processes are not predictable; ergo, determinism and predictability are 
			unrelated.
				"Stories" exist.
				The simplest case of a story is the case of a process with only a few elements; at or near the other 
			end of the spectrum we find published novels. Somewhere in the middle are the subjective realities that 
			define our experience of living a life.
				All elements within a story are real-enough within the context of the story. If your story contains an 
			element of free will then free will is real-enough in the context of you.
				Even if you accept the foregoing three enumerated statements, if your story still somehow contains an 
			element of free will then free will is still real-enough -- within your context.
