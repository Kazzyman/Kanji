Onyomi (音読み): Onyomi readings are derived from the original Chinese pronunciation of the character when it was adopted into the Japanese writing system. 
These readings are typically used when Kanji characters are part of compound words or have a specific meaning. Onyomi readings are often based on Chinese 
pronunciation and may differ from their native Japanese counterparts.
    Kunyomi (訓読み): Kunyomi readings are the native Japanese readings of Kanji characters. These readings are used when a Kanji character is used in 
isolation or at the beginning of a word. Kunyomi readings are typically associated with the character's meaning, and they can vary depending on the 
context of use. It's important to note that there are often multiple readings (both onyomi and kunyomi) for each Kanji character, and the choice of 
reading depends on the specific word or phrase in which the Kanji is used. Learning when to use each reading in different contexts is an essential 
part of mastering Kanji in the Japanese language.
