touch this is a new project created from the copy that I made before I attempted to Cmd-z my way back to a functioning state.



also tally lines of data_* files in countSLOC() func 

Eliminate all remaining duplicate entries in data_* files
re-group data files ?? 
implement the strategy for selecting cards from the various datasets, as was done in Jap2 ???

continue adding english meanings as prompts and Japanese romaji words as primary_meanings, instead of english words. 
next, add english prompts that require kana and or kanji primary_meanings  

pi and friends, GUI ??

厂 (the ‘cliff’ radical)

::: cheat-sheet :

splat e  :: list of recent files
shift splat backspace/delete  :: move to where you last made an edit
splat [  :: to return to previous position||file  (multiple such commands will walk you back from whence you came).
splat ]  :: steps forward after you have stepped back. 

option-return  :: spell correction 
double-tap shift  :: key to search everywhere

splat F6  :: change/refactor signature (:::SUPER COOL!!!) 
Shift splat U  :: toggle case
splat b  :: go to declaration 

Ctrl-k  :: kill to end of line. 

::: end cheat-sheet.
