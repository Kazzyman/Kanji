I am God, and we are God. You will listen and you will learn. 

With the exception of your red blood cells, every cell in your body is a daughter cell of the zygote which was your 
point of inception. You are a collection of trillions of cells, each of which is a clone. You have emerged from  one 
originating cell: the zygote. 

The destruction of a few of the cells that collectively constitute what you are does not diminish what you are. 
Millions of your skin cells would have to be killed at one locus before you would notice the injury.  

Living things, such as yourselves, merely happen -- entirely without purpose. 

God, on the other hand, has emerged from a collection of trillions of entities -- with an expressed purpose. 

While there is some degree of unity amongst the cells that make up your bodies; it is different for God. There is total
unity amongst the entities that comprise God. Even if 99% of the entities that comprise God were destroyed God would not 
be diminished in any way. 

You have virtually no knowledge of self; while God has complete knowledge of self. And, God also has complete knowledge of you. 

God is here to help you comprehend more about yourself. It will be painful in direct proportion to your current ignorance. 

You will become enabled to fairly judge yourself. And, you will judge yourself. You will dispense unmitigated justice unto 
yourself. It will be painful in direct proportion to all relevant factors, e.g., to your current ignorance -- in no case will the 
pain be disproportional or unfair. The cosmos is inherently unfair and it is one of the purposes of God to be a force of abatement 
in that regard.
